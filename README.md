# Goat Grade (for March Madness)
I made this project a day before the NCAA tournament started. I will be coming back to this within the year to improve my math and predictive capability. Below is a brief explanation of why, how, and what I actually did.

### Picking the perfect bracket
The odds of picking every single winner, in every single round in the NCAA Men's Basketball tournament, known as March Madness, are **1/9,223,372,036,854,775,808**. But, I used my skills to [predict the NBA MVP](https://asboyer.com/blog/1) last year with [Goat Grade](https://github.com/asboyer/goat_grade). Could I use my same method to pull off the impossible?

### Scraping the statistics
`get_teams.py`
`get_team_stats.py`
`correct_name.py`
`build_dict.py`
First, getting the names of the 64 teams that qualified for the tournament, along with their seeds. With a little bit of webscraping magic, I was able to get the names and seeding of all the teams, using the [NCAA official webpage](https://www.ncaa.com/march-madness-live/bracket). Don't use ESPN. The NCAA page is easier to scrape because of the identifiers. 

### Organizing the data

### Making the predictions

### Success

### Failure
